Functional specs:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eg: Input is this:

> Monthly rent: 15000
> Monthly telecom bill: 3000
> Monthly electricity bill: 500
> Monthly budget for groceries: 3000
> Monthly home loan EMI: 8000
> Monthly money transfer for mom: 2000
> Monthly salaries for maid and car cleaner: 1500
> Monthly budget for petrol: 1000
> Monthly money transfer for soumia: 20000
> 
> Annual LIC premium: 29500 + 511
> Annual Birla Insurance premium: 51000
> 
> Upcoming expenses (given a time period):
> Furniture (3 months): 20000
> Soha (1 year): 100000
> Advance Tax (1 month): 10000
> 
> Initial Savings: 50000
> Intended Savings per month: 20000
> 
> Goal: Jan 2011: 200000
> Annual compensation: 1000000 (do we need it?)

Output would be:

1. Whether one can meet the goal or not, with the intended savings. If not,
then what is the savings required per month to achieve the goal.

2. Expenses output for each month for next 12, 24 or 36 months including
expected savings by that time. For each month print, total expenses + expected
savings.

3. If options for the Goal (time frame) are left out, then, how long would it
be, when we would have had the goal amount.

Eg: input file would look like:

Format is: C:opts:Comment:Amount

C = character 'M' for mandatory expense (no adjustment possible)
              'B' for budgetary expense (sloppa adjustment can be made)
              'A' for annual
	      'U' for upcoming
	      'I' for initial savings
	      'S' for monthly intended savings
	      'G' for goals

opts = options depending on the expense periodicity. The options are:
    'A' Option for annual: month name in short (Jan, Feb, Apr etc)
    'U' Option for upcoming: time frame in to buy/spend/purchase:
	The timeframe could be 1M, 2M, 3Y to denote 1 month, 2 months, 3 years
	etc. Less than 1 month timeframe is bad planning.
    No options for mandatory or budgetary expenses, initial savings, and
    monthly savings as of now

Comment: reason for the expense or one line description of the expense
Amount: the amount in rupees

I:50000
S:20000
M:House Rent: 15000
M:Telecom Bill: 3000
B:Soumia: 20000
A:Jan:LIC Premium for policy no. XXXX: 29500
A:Oct:LIC Premium for policy no. YYYY: 511
U:1M:Advance Tax: 10000
U:1Y:Soha: 100000
G:Jan 2010: 200000

Output:

Goal comment: can be reached, is not possible. If not possible, then, increase
the savings, or tone down the budgetary expenses (+-10%? - this can be passed
as an option)

Jan 2010
Total expenses: 45000
Total savings: 20000

Feb 2010
Total expenses: 46000
Total savinsg: 40000

Verbose output would include the breakdown of the total expenses. Also need to
predict when I would be in position to spend on upcoming expenses.


Design specs
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Approach 1:

For each month for next year, or the time period given, have an entry in a
linked list. The linked list node would just look like (an array would do just
fine, if the number of months to be predicted is not going to be too much):

uint year
uint month
uint total_expenses
uint total_savings
linked_list of broken_down_expenses
    (this linked list would be just expense description and amount)

Then for each line of input read from the files, keep adding the expenses to
the nodes.

In the end display the list of months/nodes.


Approach 2:

Add to a linked list the type of expenses. Essentially, the records in the
input file get added to a linked list. Keep the linked list sorted
chronologically.
