The idea is to visualize the inflow and outflow of my cash reserves. I am very bad at planning finances, and often forget periodical expenses, like insurance, domain name renewal etc, which eat into my monthly income. Ideally, the app should be able to tell me, when I can plan my vacation, which would cost me Rs.200,000.

Additionally, the app should track the stocks, and tell me at a glance, what are my income and expenses.
